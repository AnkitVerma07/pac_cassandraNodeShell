title: PAC DEMO API
description:
  "RESTful API documentaiton for the NASM project. This API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to protect vital endpoints
  and access to resources. For clients that will be integrating with this API, it should be noted for all endpoints that are protected,
  the client should be listening for an HTTP status code of 401. This status code will be returned in the event that an AccessToken has
  either been revoked or expired, in which case the client should take measures to utilize the RefreshToken obtained on login to request
  a new AccessToken. At any time one should recieve a response with the status code 403 Forbidden, it is safe to assume that the user does
  not have the means or right to access the resources and should be forced to log back in through their respecitve application."
